                  The work on the video clip started in June, 2013. The band set out to capture, in
                  their common mind, that which would most accurately reflect the band’s character
                  in its debut video clip. Its production took place from June 24th to July 4th in
                  Uzhgorod and the surrounding area. At the beginning of August, production work on
                  the clip was finished and it was officially released.

                  &nbsp;- In the clip, I wanted to show the energy and assertiveness of the
                  Trystavisim band along with a common eternal search for meaning, which is a
                  characteristic pursuit of any new band.

                  The idea and sound for the piece had been in our minds during numerous concerts
                  and jam sessions. In the song, one can trace an interweaving of the band’s
                  favorite musical styles: jazz and Balkan motifs in the trumpet parts, unusual
                  rhythms in percussion, a lyrical digression of accordion with a touch of drama and
                  mysticism, riff driven guitar parts. However, the main idea of the piece is to
                  remove the listener from an everyday life and routine by telling a few simple
                  stories and immersing the listener into an atmosphere of madness and movement, as
                  born on the Transcarpathian landscape.
